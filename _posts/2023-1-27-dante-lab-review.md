## Introduction

Hey security friends, I’m gonna talk about Dante Pro Lab from Hack The Box. For those who don’t know Dante Pro Lab, it’s a lab that simulates the penetration testing engagement and provides some real-world scenarios. The lab contains 3 networks that include 14 machines, all of which you have to hack.

## Summary

To summarize the review, I will not just talk about Dante Pro Lab; I am gonna talk about Dante Pro Lab side by penetration testing in general and how to go further with your penetration testing skills.

## Who Can Take This Lab?

- Anybody wanting to take security certificates such as OSCP & eCPPT
- Anybody wanting to practice penetration testing and prove their skills
- Anybody not satisfied with hacking individual machines and wanting to tackle real-world scenarios

## What the Lab Covers

- Enumeration
- Network Pentesting
- Web Applications Pentesting
- Active Directory Pentesting
- Password Cracking & Brute Forcing
- Exploit Development
- Exploitation & Post-Exploitation
- Privilege Escalation
- Lateral Movement

## Lab Topics

### Enumeration

Enumeration is the first phase of your pentest, like home essentials. If you don’t enumerate well, you'll miss a lot. Some resources for enumeration:

- [YouTube Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvSEkPU1n0I)
- [YouTube Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=947o1ySWU2w)

### Network Pentesting

Learn about network protocols & technologies, enumerate common protocols, and pentest services. Resources for network pentesting:

- [HackTricks Book](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-network)
- [YouTube Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE)

### Web Applications Pentesting

Learn how to enumerate & exploit common web application vulnerabilities such as OWASP top 10. Resources:

- [OWASP Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/README)

### Active Directory Pentesting

Resources for Active Directory pentesting:

### Password Cracking & Brute Forcing

Resources for password cracking & brute forcing:

- [YouTube Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjVYl1Ts6XI)

### Exploit Development

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/gh0x0st/Buffer_Overflow)

### Exploitation & Post-Exploitation

Resources for exploitation & post-exploitation:

### Privilege Escalation

Resources for privilege escalation:

## Books & Courses

- [Practical Ethical Hacking Course](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course)
- [Windows Privilege Escalation Course](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/windows-privilege-escalation-for-beginners)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I had fun playing this lab and became more familiar with a lot of attacks and techniques. In my opinion, the lab contains around 60% of real-world scenarios. Another point is that the labs teach you about the full penetration testing lifecycle & engagement. For example, the labs contain an enterprise network where you have to move further than just hacking a machine and getting root. You have to note every single point to reuse the creds or whatever you got in moving inside the enterprise. Last thing to do is to practice more and never stop research. Don’t just aim to finish the lab; aim to gain more knowledge and sharpen your skills.
